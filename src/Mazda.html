    <p class="summary2">Ever wondered how a Japanese car company that “Celebrates Driving” got its name?

        The name “Mazda” was introduced to Japan in October 1931. Mazda started its life as a cork manufacturer back in 1920. The year 1931 was when Mazda, then called the Toyo Kogyo Co., Ltd.,
        launched the “Mazda-go”, a tricycle truck which is a first vehicle coming out of the company. The naming of the tricycle was considered by Jujiro Matsuda, the second president and
        substantial founder of Toyo Kogyo, and other key members.
        Made by a company that was then managed by a man named Matsuda, the name “Mazda-go” sounds fitting enough. The question is, how come it was spelt “Mazda” instead of “Matsuda”?
        “Mazda” comes from Ahura Mazda, the god of harmony, intelligence and wisdom from the earliest civilization in West Asia. Key members of Toyo Kogyo interpreted Mazda as a symbol of
        the beginning of the East and the West civilization, but also a symbol of the automotive civilization and culture. Striving to make a contribution to the world peace and to be a light
        in the automotive industry, Toyo Kogyo was renamed Mazda Motor Corporation. “Mazda” was also a perfect way to pay respect to the substantial founder, whose family name is pronounced
        very close to “Mazda”.
